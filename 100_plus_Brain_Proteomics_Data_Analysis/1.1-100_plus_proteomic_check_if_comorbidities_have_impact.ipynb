       "Brain with senile involutive cortical changes (Thal stage 3 of 5 for amyloid beta and Braak stage 2 of 6 for tauopathy). Additionally slight primary, age related tauopathy (tau in glial cells). In addition, slight alpha-synucleinopathy is found (Braak stage 1 of 6 for Lewy body disease). All this did not have any clinical consequences yet. Furthermore cerebral amyloid angiopathy type 1 (including capillary amyloid angiopathy). As incidental finding a small cavernous hemangioma is found in the subcortical white matter. In the white matter signs of hypertension and some iron pigment macrophages around vessels are found. In the cortex a few old, recent and beginning microinfarctions are found (fitting microthrombi).\r\n",

       "CLINICAL COURSE In 1994, with 76 years of age, the patient reported some memory impairment. Slowly his physical condition deteriorated. At the age of 91 he was diagnosed with polyneurophathy, atrial fibrillations and heart failure. He probably experienced a TIA. Heart failure progressively impaired the patient's mobility, but with some help for personal care and hygiene the patient lived independently until 2011. During hospitalization for progressive COPD and heart failure the patient suffered from delirium related to urinary retention. In 2011 the patient was admitted to a nursing home. Mild cognitive slowing and anxiety were observed. Severe exacerbation of COPD and heart failure led to some disorientation shortly before the patient's sudden death.\r\n",

Not the picture of Alzheimer's disease. There are a few old infarctions in the left temporal and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, a small periventricular infarction is seen behind the caudate nucleus and microscopically small old infarctions (0.1 - 0.2 cm) occipitally and very focally in the hippocampus. Also, a recent infarction (0.1 cm) is seen in the pons. Infarctions were not found in the basal ganglia\r\n",

       "Epicrise: Autopsy of 90 year old woman, with a history of hypertension, arthritis, extensive eczema, atrial fibrillation and heart failure, who died after two days of fever, possibly caused by pneumonia. The patient registered at the NBB as a control donor, but had neurological testing two months prior to death after she had fallen, where confusion and disorientation in time were seen. Also her responses were not always adequate. The patient was visually impaired and hard hearing. She lived in an elderly home, where she needed much care and she was incontinent, but she was not demented. Her dementia score was only 0.5. \r\n",
       "The CT-scan showed extensive atrophy in the brain, with dilated ventricles, an infarction in the occipital lobe, and lacunar infarctions in the basal nuclei. At autopsy, small old infarctions were found occipitally, temporally and just behind the caudate nucleus. There were no infarctions in the basal nuclei. Occipitally and in the hippocampus, very small glial scars were found. Furthermore, there was a recent small infarction in the pons, which fits a thromboembolism at atrial fibrillation. In the (trans)entorhinal cortex, subiculum and Ammon's horn CA1, many (pre)tangles were seen with the tau stain (fitting a Braak stage of at most 3 out of 6 for tau). At most, a moderate amount of tau positive neurons were seen temporally. There was also much glial tau positivity, especially around the ventricles, vessels and subpially. This all fits a primarily age-related tauopathy (PART). There were no neuritic plaques, therefore the diagnosis Alzheimer's disease was ruled out. There were some senile changes with diffuse amyloid beta plaques (Thal stage 3 out of 5) and a few congophilic plaques. Focally, slight capillary amyloid angiopathy was seen occipitally.

       "Autopsy of a 91 year old woman without cognitive impairment, who had donated her brain as a control donor. During the days prior to death, she suffered from stomach aches and shortness of breath. She passed away at home, lonely and unexpectedly, probably due to a cardiac cause. At autopsy no macroscopic abnormalities were found, except slight atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Microscopically, a moderate number of senile plaques were found at the most. The Braak stage was 3 at most for tau, with tangles in the (trans)entorhinal cortex, hippocampus (especially the subiculum and CA1), amygdala and temporal cortex. This is fitting for her age and had possibly led to slight memory impairments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

There were no beta amyloid depositions present apart from sporadically a single one in a congophilic vessel in the cortex parieto-occipitally and in a part of the leptomeningeal vessels. No diffuse plaques. The hippocampus showed at the left hippocampal sclerosis of CA1 besides the tauopathy described above.

The abnormalities consisted of tangles but no senile plaques (which are expected in Alzheimer's disease).

       "CLINICAL COURSE Patient was a relatively healthy old woman, except for minor heart rhythm disturbances, hypertension and relapsing ileus. The first heart problems were observed when patient was 51 years of age. Hypertension and a sinus rhythm were found. At the age of 64 years patient underwent resection of the small intestine because of relapsing ileus. From 2006 patient had repetitive collapses mostly without clear cause. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. During 2007 patient's condition gradually decreased by urinary tract infections and progressive heart problems.\r\n",

       "INTOXICATION Patient smoked heavily until 1998.\r\n",
       "CLINICAL COURSE Patient was a well-groomed, relatively healthy woman, who was socially well embedded. Around her 65th year of age she started to experience problems with concentration and memory. In 1994 she had problems with word finding and could not remember names. Examination showed a confused woman with a MMSE score of 20 out of 30. She was slightly disoriented in time and place. She was diagnosed with dementia, possibly of the Alzheimer type. Between 1995 and 1998 the symptoms progressed and in 1998 she was admitted to a nursing home. Her cognition had declined and she experienced problems speaking. In the nursing home patient refused care, she was aggressive and agitated, especially during the night. After some time and adjusted medication patient became drowsy and her aphasia grew worse. The following years were characterised by a very slow progression of cognitive decline. Since 2001 patient had contractures of the hands that were painful. During the last years patient had a few relapses of urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections. During such periods patient ate and drank very little, whereas normally she had a very good appetite. Her physical condition deteriorated and in 2007 relapsing respiratory tract infections had worn her out. She died of a combination of a respiratory tract infection and decompensatio cordis.\r\n",

       "Brain with senile involutive cortical changes (Thal stage 3 of 5 for amyloid beta and Braak stage 2 of 6 for tauopathy). Additionally slight primary, age related tauopathy (tau in glial cells). In addition, slight alpha-synucleinopathy is found (Braak stage 1 of 6 for Lewy body disease). All this did not have any clinical consequences yet. Furthermore cerebral amyloid angiopathy type 1 (including capillary amyloid angiopathy). As incidental finding a small cavernous hemangioma is found in the subcortical white matter. In the white matter signs of hypertension and some iron pigment macrophages around vessels are found. In the cortex a few old, recent and beginning microinfarctions are found (fitting microthrombi).\r\n",

       "CLINICAL COURSE In 1994, with 76 years of age, the patient reported some memory impairment. Slowly his physical condition deteriorated. At the age of 91 he was diagnosed with polyneurophathy, atrial fibrillations and heart failure. He probably experienced a TIA. Heart failure progressively impaired the patient's mobility, but with some help for personal care and hygiene the patient lived independently until 2011. During hospitalization for progressive COPD and heart failure the patient suffered from delirium related to urinary retention. In 2011 the patient was admitted to a nursing home. Mild cognitive slowing and anxiety were observed. Severe exacerbation of COPD and heart failure led to some disorientation shortly before the patient's sudden death.\r\n",

Over 2005 and 2006 patient was anaemic because of blood loss through the colon, and his heart and renal functions further decreased. In May a critical situation existed when patient lost consciousness. Within four weeks colon polyps were removed, as was the endoprosthesis, patient contracted sepsis by Streptococcus aureus and pneumonia.

Not the picture of Alzheimer's disease. There are a few old infarctions in the left temporal and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, a small periventricular infarction is seen behind the caudate nucleus and microscopically small old infarctions (0.1 - 0.2 cm) occipitally and very focally in the hippocampus. Also, a recent infarction (0.1 cm) is seen in the pons. Infarctions were not found in the basal ganglia\r\n",

The patient registered at the NBB as a control donor, but had neurological testing two months prior to death after she had fallen, where confusion and disorientation in time were seen. Also her responses were not always adequate. The patient was visually impaired and hard hearing. She lived in an elderly home, where she needed much care and she was incontinent, but she was not demented. Her dementia score was only 0.5. \r\n",
       "The CT-scan showed extensive atrophy in the brain, with dilated ventricles, an infarction in the occipital lobe, and lacunar infarctions in the basal nuclei. At autopsy, small old infarctions were found occipitally, temporally and just behind the caudate nucleus. There were no infarctions in the basal nuclei. Occipitally and in the hippocampus, very small glial scars were found. Furthermore, there was a recent small infarction in the pons, which fits a thromboembolism at atrial fibrillation. In the (trans)entorhinal cortex, subiculum and Ammon's horn CA1, many (pre)tangles were seen with the tau stain (fitting a Braak stage of at most 3 out of 6 for tau). At most, a moderate amount of tau positive neurons were seen temporally. There was also much glial tau positivity, especially around the ventricles, vessels and subpially. This all fits a primarily age-related tauopathy (PART). There were no neuritic plaques, therefore the diagnosis Alzheimer's disease was ruled out. There were some senile changes with diffuse amyloid beta plaques (Thal stage 3 out of 5) and a few congophilic plaques. Focally, slight capillary amyloid angiopathy was seen occipitally. The symptoms of dubious dementia (disturbances in orientation, disinterest, loss of initiative, incontinence) most probably can be explained by the senile tauopathy\r\n",

The pulmonary situation was stable. In 1991 patient was short of breath and examination showed coronary insufficiency and rhythm disturbances. Patient underwent PTCA and Dotter treatment. In 2008 a prostate carcinoma was found. The tumor responded well to LH-RH agonist treatment. In June 2009 a rectal adenocarcinoma was observed. After radiotherapy the condition deteriorated and Fentanyl and Morphine were prescribed for the pain.\r\n",

       "Autopsy of a 91 year old woman without cognitive impairment, who had donated her brain as a control donor. During the days prior to death, she suffered from stomach aches and shortness of breath. She passed away at home, lonely and unexpectedly, probably due to a cardiac cause. At autopsy no macroscopic abnormalities were found, except slight atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Microscopically, a moderate number of senile plaques were found at the most. The Braak stage was 3 at most for tau, with tangles in the (trans)entorhinal cortex, hippocampus (especially the subiculum and CA1), amygdala and temporal cortex. This is fitting for her age and had possibly led to slight memory impairments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

       "At autopsy, a primary senile tauopathy was determined with a Braak stage 3 of 6 (nearly beginning 4), and a lot of thorn-like astrocytes around the ventricle. There were no beta amyloid depositions present apart from sporadically a single one in a congophilic vessel in the cortex parieto-occipitally and in a part of the leptomeningeal vessels. No diffuse plaques. The hippocampus showed at the left hippocampal sclerosis of CA1 besides the tauopathy described above. As an incidental finding a single Lewy body was found in the medulla oblongata (10th nerve nucleus), fitting a Braak stage 1 of 6 for alpha-synucleinopathy.

       "At autopsy clear aging phenomenon were found within the hippocampus, temporal cortex and parahippocampal cortex; a bit less in the inferior parietal lobe and the amygdala. The abnormalities consisted of tangles but no senile plaques (which are expected in Alzheimer's disease). Also rather many tau changes were found in the glial cells as often is described at high age (so beginning stage of tangles only dementia). Therefore the diagnosis is senile tauopathy.(Senile complex tauopathie with glial involvement) This can declare her cognitive dysfunction in the last stage.

       "CLINICAL COURSE Patient was a well-groomed, relatively healthy woman, who was socially well embedded. Around her 65th year of age she started to experience problems with concentration and memory. In 1994 she had problems with word finding and could not remember names. Examination showed a confused woman with a MMSE score of 20 out of 30. She was slightly disoriented in time and place. She was diagnosed with dementia, possibly of the Alzheimer type. Between 1995 and 1998 the symptoms progressed and in 1998 she was admitted to a nursing home. Her cognition had declined and she experienced problems speaking. In the nursing home patient refused care, she was aggressive and agitated, especially during the night. After some time and adjusted medication patient became drowsy and her aphasia grew worse. The following years were characterised by a very slow progression of cognitive decline. Since 2001 patient had contractures of the hands that were painful. During the last years patient had a few relapses of urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections. During such periods patient ate and drank very little, whereas normally she had a very good appetite. Her physical condition deteriorated and in 2007 relapsing respiratory tract infections had worn her out. She died of a combination of a respiratory tract infection and decompensatio cordis.\r\n",

       "Brain with senile involutive cortical changes (Thal stage 3 of 5 for amyloid beta and Braak stage 2 of 6 for tauopathy). Additionally slight primary, age related tauopathy (tau in glial cells). In addition, slight alpha-synucleinopathy is found (Braak stage 1 of 6 for Lewy body disease). All this did not have any clinical consequences yet. Furthermore cerebral amyloid angiopathy type 1 (including capillary amyloid angiopathy). As incidental finding a small cavernous hemangioma is found in the subcortical white matter. In the white matter signs of hypertension and some iron pigment macrophages around vessels are found. In the cortex a few old, recent and beginning microinfarctions are found (fitting microthrombi).\r\n",

       "CLINICAL COURSE In 1994, with 76 years of age, the patient reported some memory impairment. Slowly his physical condition deteriorated. At the age of 91 he was diagnosed with polyneurophathy, atrial fibrillations and heart failure. He probably experienced a TIA. Heart failure progressively impaired the patient's mobility, but with some help for personal care and hygiene the patient lived independently until 2011. During hospitalization for progressive COPD and heart failure the patient suffered from delirium related to urinary retention. In 2011 the patient was admitted to a nursing home. Mild cognitive slowing and anxiety were observed. Severe exacerbation of COPD and heart failure led to some disorientation shortly before the patient's sudden death.\r\n",

After this patient's heart condition remained weak and renal functions were severely disturbed. Over 2005 and 2006 patient was anaemic because of blood loss through the colon, and his heart and renal functions further decreased. In May a critical situation existed when patient lost consciousness. Within four weeks colon polyps were removed, as was the endoprosthesis, patient contracted sepsis by Streptococcus aureus and pneumonia.

Not the picture of Alzheimer's disease. There are a few old infarctions in the left temporal and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, a small periventricular infarction is seen behind the caudate nucleus and microscopically small old infarctions (0.1 - 0.2 cm) occipitally and very focally in the hippocampus. Also, a recent infarction (0.1 cm) is seen in the pons. Infarctions were not found in the basal ganglia\r\n",

       "Epicrise: Autopsy of 90 year old woman, with a history of hypertension, arthritis, extensive eczema, atrial fibrillation and heart failure, who died after two days of fever, possibly caused by pneumonia. The patient registered at the NBB as a control donor, but had neurological testing two months prior to death after she had fallen, where confusion and disorientation in time were seen. Also her responses were not always adequate. The patient was visually impaired and hard hearing. She lived in an elderly home, where she needed much care and she was incontinent, but she was not demented. Her dementia score was only 0.5. \r\n",
       "The CT-scan showed extensive atrophy in the brain, with dilated ventricles, an infarction in the occipital lobe, and lacunar infarctions in the basal nuclei. At autopsy, small old infarctions were found occipitally, temporally and just behind the caudate nucleus. There were no infarctions in the basal nuclei. Occipitally and in the hippocampus, very small glial scars were found. Furthermore, there was a recent small infarction in the pons, which fits a thromboembolism at atrial fibrillation. In the (trans)entorhinal cortex, subiculum and Ammon's horn CA1, many (pre)tangles were seen with the tau stain (fitting a Braak stage of at most 3 out of 6 for tau). At most, a moderate amount of tau positive neurons were seen temporally. There was also much glial tau positivity, especially around the ventricles, vessels and subpially. This all fits a primarily age-related tauopathy (PART). There were no neuritic plaques, therefore the diagnosis Alzheimer's disease was ruled out. There were some senile changes with diffuse amyloid beta plaques (Thal stage 3 out of 5) and a few congophilic plaques. Focally, slight capillary amyloid angiopathy was seen occipitally. The symptoms of dubious dementia (disturbances in orientation, disinterest, loss of initiative, incontinence) most probably can be explained by the senile tauopathy\r\n",

The pulmonary situation was stable. In 1991 patient was short of breath and examination showed coronary insufficiency and rhythm disturbances. Patient underwent PTCA and Dotter treatment. In 2008 a prostate carcinoma was found. The tumor responded well to LH-RH agonist treatment. In June 2009 a rectal adenocarcinoma was observed. After radiotherapy the condition deteriorated and Fentanyl and Morphine were prescribed for the pain.\r\n",

       "Autopsy of a 91 year old woman without cognitive impairment, who had donated her brain as a control donor. During the days prior to death, she suffered from stomach aches and shortness of breath. She passed away at home, lonely and unexpectedly, probably due to a cardiac cause. At autopsy no macroscopic abnormalities were found, except slight atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Microscopically, a moderate number of senile plaques were found at the most. The Braak stage was 3 at most for tau, with tangles in the (trans)entorhinal cortex, hippocampus (especially the subiculum and CA1), amygdala and temporal cortex. This is fitting for her age and had possibly led to slight memory impairments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

       "At autopsy, a primary senile tauopathy was determined with a Braak stage 3 of 6 (nearly beginning 4), and a lot of thorn-like astrocytes around the ventricle. There were no beta amyloid depositions present apart from sporadically a single one in a congophilic vessel in the cortex parieto-occipitally and in a part of the leptomeningeal vessels. No diffuse plaques. The hippocampus showed at the left hippocampal sclerosis of CA1 besides the tauopathy described above. As an incidental finding a single Lewy body was found in the medulla oblongata (10th nerve nucleus), fitting a Braak stage 1 of 6 for alpha-synucleinopathy.

       "At autopsy clear aging phenomenon were found within the hippocampus, temporal cortex and parahippocampal cortex; a bit less in the inferior parietal lobe and the amygdala. The abnormalities consisted of tangles but no senile plaques (which are expected in Alzheimer's disease). Also rather many tau changes were found in the glial cells as often is described at high age (so beginning stage of tangles only dementia). Therefore the diagnosis is senile tauopathy.(Senile complex tauopathie with glial involvement) This can declare her cognitive dysfunction in the last stage.

       "CLINICAL COURSE Patient was a well-groomed, relatively healthy woman, who was socially well embedded. Around her 65th year of age she started to experience problems with concentration and memory. In 1994 she had problems with word finding and could not remember names. Examination showed a confused woman with a MMSE score of 20 out of 30. She was slightly disoriented in time and place. She was diagnosed with dementia, possibly of the Alzheimer type. Between 1995 and 1998 the symptoms progressed and in 1998 she was admitted to a nursing home. Her cognition had declined and she experienced problems speaking. In the nursing home patient refused care, she was aggressive and agitated, especially during the night. After some time and adjusted medication patient became drowsy and her aphasia grew worse. The following years were characterised by a very slow progression of cognitive decline. Since 2001 patient had contractures of the hands that were painful. During the last years patient had a few relapses of urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections. During such periods patient ate and drank very little, whereas normally she had a very good appetite. Her physical condition deteriorated and in 2007 relapsing respiratory tract infections had worn her out. She died of a combination of a respiratory tract infection and decompensatio cordis.\r\n",

CONCLUSION: 1) with the exception of slight senile involutive cortical changes (Braak stage for tangles = 1, for amyloid = B), there are no abnormalities. 2) lipoma (cauda equina).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "5   1982 May: The patient was seen pre-operatively by an internist. Examination revealed she was depressive. Further psychiatric examination revealed no abnormalities. No further information could be retrieved from the medical information about the character or duration of this mentioned depressive state. 1990 May: The patient had fallen of the stairs at home and prior she collapsed on the street without prodromi and e causa ignota. The ECG excluded the probability of an Adams-Stokes attack. 2000 She appeared to be a vital woman who was very capable of doing her activities of daily living. \\r\\nCOGNITIVE STATE (during the last two months)\\r\\n-Linguistic capability\\r\\n-Ability to speak\\r\\n-Communicative skills\\r\\n-Memory\\r\\n-Orientation\\r\\n-Concentration\\r\\n-Ability to act\\r\\n-Need for care\\r\\nno abnormalities\\r\\n-Psychiatric problems\\r\\nnone\\r\\nCONCLUSION:\\r\\n1.

Alcohol consumption unknown. \\r\\nC LINICAL HISTORY In July patient was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with pre-psychotic syndrome. Patient had strongly fluctuating mood swings, was labile and intermittently aggressive. The affect showed little mdulation. In addition there were mild memory problems and disorientation in time. (1975) In November patient was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with nearly psychotic behavior, characterized by unreal and theatrical behavior, difficulty in contacting, dysphoric mood and emotionality charged with hard feelings. (1984)\\r\\nPatient was overweight. 2011: In February patient was hospitalized through the emergency room with decompensatio cordis and exacerbation of COPD. Patient was confused and depressive. Psychiatric examination showed\\r\\nincreased associative speech. The consciousness was lucid, attention was easily disturbed by distraction. It was concluded that patient had an urge to move. She had been delirious. \\r\\nCLINICAL COURSE Between 1975 and 1985 patient was twice admitted to a psychiatric ward with prepsychotic syndrome. From the age of 74 years patient developed cardiovascular problems and pulmonary problems related to tobacco abuse.

       "12  Cause of death: Heart failure\\r\\n(2006) In September the patient was dizzy. He experienced two falls. His physical condition deteriorated and memory impairment increased. Orientation, attention and memory were mildly impaired. MMSE was 25/30. \\r\\nSome bradyphrenia and anxiety was observed. In November dyspnoe increased and the patient needed oxygen treatment. Verbal communication was severely impaired because of dyspnoe. Mild cognitive deterioration was assumed to be compensated by the patient's intelligence.\\r\\nCLINICAL COURSE In 1994, with 76 years of age, the patient reported some memory impairment. Slowly his physical condition deteriorated. At the age of 91 he was diagnosed with polyneurophathy, atrial fibrillations and heart failure. He probably experienced a TIA. Heart failure progressively impaired the patient's mobility, but with some help for personal care and hygiene the patient lived independently until 2011. During hospitalization for progressive COPD and heart failure the patient suffered from delirium related to urinary retention. In 2011 the patient was admitted to a nursing home. Mild cognitive slowing and anxiety were observed. Severe exacerbation of COPD and heart failure led to some disorientation shortly before the patient's sudden death.\\r\\nConclusion: Very slight (especially for age) senile involutive cortical changes (Braak stage for tangles = 1, for amyloid = \"O\"); during his recent stay at a rehabilitation center, no cognitive decline was observed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "13  CLINICAL COURSE In 1996 patient suffered a major myocardial infarct. After this patient's heart condition remained weak and renal functions were severely disturbed. Over 2005 and 2006 patient was anaemic because of blood loss through the colon, and his heart and renal functions further decreased. In May a critical situation existed when patient lost consciousness. Within four weeks colon polyps were removed, as was the endoprosthesis, patient contracted sepsis by Streptococcus aureus and pneumonia. Patient recovered but heart dysfunction and renal insufficiency increased Patient was unable to produce urine and became oedematous. He died of renal insufficiency and heart failure. \\r\\nCOGNITIVE STATE\\r\\nLinguistic capabilities: not disturbed\\r\\nAbility to speak:not disturbed\\r\\nCommunicative skills: not disturbed\\r\\nMemory: not disturbed\\r\\nOrientation: not disturbed\\r\\nPsychiatric problems: None\\r\\nCONCLUSION:\\r\\nModerate senile-involutive cortical changes (Braak stage for tangles = 2, for amyloid = \"O\")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "19  Cause of death: Possible infection, fever with unknown focus.\\r\\nThe patient's daughter reported that she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome/ ADD\\r\\nCLINICAL COURSE\\r\\nThe patient often complained of fatigue, sickness, dizziness and headaches in the last 20 years. She subscribed these complaints to myalgic encephalomyelitis herself, but no objective diagnosis was reported. The patient often visited a homeopathic practitioner and used several homeopathic supplements. She also suffered from cognitive deterioration, but was never diagnosed with dementia.\\r\\nMemory: Mildly disturbed\\r\\nOrientation: Moderately disturbed\\r\\nConclusion: Brain with primarily age-related tauopathy (at most Braak stage 3 out of 6 for tau) and only few congophilic plaques, no neuritic plaque (amyloid beta phase 3 out of 5), which is conform age. Not the picture of Alzheimer's disease. There are a few old infarctions in the left temporal and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, a small periventricular infarction is seen behind the caudate nucleus and microscopically small old infarctions (0.1 - 0.2 cm) occipitally and very focally in the hippocampus. Also, a recent infarction (0.1 cm) is seen in the pons. Infarctions were not found in the basal ganglia\\r\\nitself (in contrast to the interpretation of the CT scan).\\r\\nEpicrise: Autopsy of 90 year old woman, with a history of hypertension, arthritis, extensive eczema, atrial fibrillation and heart failure, who died after two days of fever, possibly caused by pneumonia. The patient registered at the NBB as a control donor, but had neurological testing two months prior to death after she had fallen, where confusion and disorientation in time were seen. Also her responses were not always adequate. The patient was visually impaired and hard hearing. She lived in an elderly home, where she needed much care and she was incontinent, but she was not demented. Her dementia score was only 0.5. \\r\\nThe CT-scan showed extensive atrophy in the brain, with dilated ventricles, an infarction in the occipital lobe, and lacunar infarctions in the basal nuclei. At autopsy, small old infarctions were found occipitally, temporally and just behind the caudate nucleus. There were no infarctions in the basal nuclei. Occipitally and in the hippocampus, very small glial scars were found. Furthermore, there was a recent small infarction in the pons, which fits a thromboembolism at atrial fibrillation. In the (trans)entorhinal cortex, subiculum and Ammon's horn CA1, many (pre)tangles were seen with the tau stain (fitting a Braak stage of at most 3 out of 6 for tau). At most, a moderate amount of tau positive neurons were seen temporally. There was also much glial tau positivity, especially around the ventricles, vessels and subpially. This all fits a primarily age-related tauopathy (PART). There were no neuritic plaques, therefore the diagnosis Alzheimer's disease was ruled out. There were some senile changes with diffuse amyloid beta plaques (Thal stage 3 out of 5) and a few congophilic plaques. Focally, slight capillary amyloid angiopathy was seen occipitally. The symptoms of dubious dementia (disturbances in orientation, disinterest, loss of initiative, incontinence) most probably can be explained by the senile tauopathy\\r\\n\n",

       "22  CLINICAL COURSE Patient was longtime known with COPD. The pulmonary situation was stable. In 1991 patient was short of breath and examination showed coronary insufficiency and rhythm disturbances. Patient underwent PTCA and Dotter treatment. In 2008 a prostate carcinoma was found. The tumor responded well to LH-RH agonist treatment. In June 2009 a rectal adenocarcinoma was observed. After radiotherapy the condition deteriorated and Fentanyl and Morphine were prescribed for the pain.\\r\\nCOGNITIVE STATE\\r\\nLinguistic capabilities: not disturbed\\r\\nAbility to speak:not disturbed\\r\\nCommunicative skills: not disturbed\\r\\nMemory: not disturbed\\r\\nOrientation: not disturbed\\r\\nPsychiatric problems: none\\r\\nCONCLUSION: Brain with senile-involutive cortical changes (Braak stage for tangles = 3, for amyloid = B) and some congophilic angiopathy.

During the days prior to death, she suffered from stomach aches and shortness of breath. She passed away at home, lonely and unexpectedly, probably due to a cardiac cause. At autopsy no macroscopic abnormalities were found, except slight atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Microscopically, a moderate number of senile plaques were found at the most. The Braak stage was 3 at most for tau, with tangles in the (trans)entorhinal cortex, hippocampus (especially the subiculum and CA1), amygdala and temporal cortex. This is fitting for her age and had possibly led to slight memory impairments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

(2012) However, no evidence for dementia was found with neuropsychological assessment.\\r\\nConclusion:\\r\\nBrain with senile tauopathy (Braak stage 3) with also glial changes. Only a few classic plaques are found (thus no beginning Alzheimer's disease). The tau changes can explain the cognitive decline in the last stage very well. Furthermore beginning infarctions were found fitting terminal embolism.\\r\\nAt autopsy clear aging phenomenon were found within the hippocampus, temporal cortex and parahippocampal cortex; a bit less in the inferior parietal lobe and the amygdala. The abnormalities consisted of tangles but no senile plaques (which are expected in Alzheimer's disease). Also rather many tau changes were found in the glial cells as often is described at high age (so beginning stage of tangles only dementia). Therefore the diagnosis is senile tauopathy.(Senile complex tauopathie with glial involvement) This can declare her cognitive dysfunction in the last stage.

The patient's cognitive state was very variable, sometimes the patient could be very clear, and on another day he could be very confused. The patient stayed at home with help from his daughter, and with help of the district nurses. In 2000 the situation became very difficult, and the patient was admitted to a nursing home. The patient's situation got worse in the nursing home. Especially the apraxia got worse. The patient developed difficulties with swallowing, and developed Parkinsonism and depression. The patient was incontinent for faeces, and at night for urine as well. The physical condition got worse quite suddenly.

Mother was mentally normal until a high age.\\r\\nINTOXICATION Patient smoked heavily until 1998.\\r\\nCLINICAL COURSE Patient was a well-groomed, relatively healthy woman, who was socially well embedded. Around her 65th year of age she started to experience problems with concentration and memory. In 1994 she had problems with word finding and could not remember names. Examination showed a confused woman with a MMSE score of 20 out of 30. She was slightly disoriented in time and place. She was diagnosed with dementia, possibly of the Alzheimer type. Between 1995 and 1998 the symptoms progressed and in 1998 she was admitted to a nursing home. Her cognition had declined and she experienced problems speaking. In the nursing home patient refused care, she was aggressive and agitated, especially during the night. After some time and adjusted medication patient became drowsy and her aphasia grew worse. The following years were characterised by a very slow progression of cognitive decline. Since 2001 patient had contractures of the hands that were painful. During the last years patient had a few relapses of urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections. During such periods patient ate and drank very little, whereas normally she had a very good appetite. Her physical condition deteriorated and in 2007 relapsing respiratory tract infections had worn her out. She died of a combination of a respiratory tract infection and decompensatio cordis.\\r\\nLinguistic capabilities: disturbed\\r\\nAbility to speak:severely disturbed\\r\\nCommunicative skills: severely disturbed\\r\\nMemory: disturbed\\r\\nOrientation: mildly disturbed\\r\\nPsychiatric problems: Character changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSION: 1.

Extremely severe atrophy, relative spared motorcortex and occipital cortex. The brain feels gliotic. The basal nuclei are very small. The substantia nigra is well pigmented. The locus coeruleus is not clearly visible. The whole ventricular system is very wide. 21-07-2010: The hippocampus is very small just like the amygdala. Severely atrophy frontotemporally. It is less severe parietally and occipitally. The ventricular system is very wide especially temporally and frontally. The locus coeruleus is not visible.\\r\\nTemporal pole: The cortex shows moderate to severe degeneration, with gliosis through the whole cortex, and severe neuronal losses in layers 2, 3A and in many places also in layer 5.
